A simple library app that you can add/remove books into and toggle their read status.

## Technical highlights:
- Structured with *HTML* and vanilla *JavaScript*, using OOP principles and the ES6 `class` syntax.
  - Played around with JS's `this` binding (and using arrow functions to work around it) as well as static methods
  - Manual DOM manipulation
- Styled in plain *CSS* (flexbox wrap)

## Features to be added:
- Use CSS grid for layout (flexbox wrap can't do centering very well)
- Fancier styling!
